# 🔐 Caesar Cipher Tool

A simple yet powerful **Caesar Cipher encryption & decryption app** built with **Python + Streamlit**.
This project lets you **securely transform your messages** by shifting letters through the classical Caesar Cipher technique—an ancient encryption method used by Julius Caesar himself! 🏛️

---

## 📖 Project Overview

The **Caesar Cipher Tool** provides an interactive way to **encrypt and decrypt messages** with just a few clicks.

* Built with **Streamlit** for a smooth and user-friendly UI.
* Handles both **uppercase and lowercase letters** correctly.
* Preserves **spaces, numbers, and special characters**.
* Uses **session state** so you can directly decrypt after encrypting without retyping.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ Encrypt messages with a customizable shift (1–25).
✅ Decrypt instantly with the same shift.
✅ Interactive **slider-based control** for shift value.
✅ Real-time results in a clean UI.
✅ Beginner-friendly & easy to run locally.

## 🖥️ How It Works

1. Enter your text message.
2. Select a **shift value** (1–25).
3. Click **Encrypt** to scramble your message.
4. Click **Decrypt** to get the original back.

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting letters in the alphabet:

```
Plaintext:  HELLO
Shift:      3
Ciphertext: KHOOR
```
